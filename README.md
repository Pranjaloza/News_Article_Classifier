# üì∞ News Article Classification: Fake vs Real using BERT

## Objective
This project classifies news statements as **Fake** or **Real** using a fine-tuned BERT transformer model trained on the LIAR dataset. It includes an interactive web interface built using **Streamlit**.

---

## ‚öô Features
- Fine-tuned BERT (`bert-base-uncased`) model using Hugging Face
- Binary classification: Fake (0), Real (1)
- Trained on the LIAR dataset (political statements)
- Real-time prediction interface via Streamlit

---

## üß† Model Training

Training performed using the notebook `FakeNews_Training.ipynb`.  
Label mapping:
- ‚ùå Fake: `pants-fire`, `false`, `barely-true`
- ‚úÖ Real: `half-true`, `mostly-true`, `true`

---

## Dataset

The project uses the LIAR dataset in three files:
- `train.tsv`
- `valid.tsv`
- `test.tsv`

These are included in the repository.
